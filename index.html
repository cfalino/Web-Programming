		<!-- Beginning of my bulleted points about Claudette  -->
		<h2> 
			<i> Everyone believes Rosa Parks was the first to protest giving up her seat during the Civil Rights Movement... <b> but was she?</b> </i>

		<h3>
			<p> 
				<ul> <li> On the way home from high school in 1955, then 15-year-old Claudette Colvin refused to get up to make room for a white woman on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. </li> </ul>

				<br>

				<ul> <li> According to the rules at that time, if a bus were to become so crowded that all the "white seats" were occupied and a white person was left standing, any African American was expected to get up from his/her seat to allow the white person to sit. </li> </ul>

				<br>

				<ul> <li> The bus driver asked Claudette to get up and Claudette refused. He signaled to police men to come force her to move and she <i> still </i> refused. The policemen forcibly removed her from the bus. </li> </ul>

				<ul> <li> Claudette's mother Mary told her daughter "Be quiet about what you did. Let Rosa be the one - white people aren't going to bother Rosa, they like her." </li> </ul>
