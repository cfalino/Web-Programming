				<ul> <li> On the way home from high school in 1955, then 15-year-old Claudette Colvin refused to get up to make room for a white woman on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. </li> </ul>

				<br>

				<ul> <li> According to the rules at that time, if a bus were to become so crowded that all the "white seats" were occupied and a white person was left standing, any African American was expected to get up from his/her seat to allow the white person to sit. </li> </ul>

				<br>

				<ul> <li> The bus driver asked Claudette to get up and Claudette refused. He signaled to police men to come force her to move and she <i> still </i> refused. The policemen forcibly removed her from the bus. </li> </ul>
