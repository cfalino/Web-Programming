		<div> Understanding Disability Through the Capability Approach </div>

		<p>Health is a major concern is Sen’s capability approach, whether
		it is considered as part of an individual’s well-being or whether
		health equity is analyzed as part of the justice of social arrangements
		(Sen, 2002). Disability has not received as much attention
		as health in Sen’s work. However, his work is peppered
		with references to persons with impairments or chronic illnesses
		(see Note 2). His focus is on the impact of personal
		characteristics, including what he calls a handicap or disability,
		which is an impairment in disability theory, on a person’s
		capabilities set and the assessment of poverty and well-being.
		Impairment is considered an example of the personal characteristics that should be taken into account in assessing poverty and personal well-being. Under the traditional opulence or
		utility approach in economics, a person is considered better off
		than someone else if he or she can command more commodities,
		irrespective of whether the person has an impairment. For
		instance, according to Sen (1999): </p>
		<br>
		<div class="fixed"> A person who is disabled may have a larger basket
		of primary goods and have less chance to lead a normal
		life (or to pursue her objectives) than an ablebodied
		person with a smaller basket of primary
		goods. Similarly, an older person or a person more
		prone to illness can be more disadvantaged in a generally
		accepted sense even with a larger bundle of
		primary goods. (p. 74; see Note 3) </div>
		<br>

		<p>Can the capability approach help to define disability at
		the conceptual level? In other words, does it account for the experience
		of persons with disabilities effectively? Sen has not
		used the capability approach to define disability, so the answer
		to this question attempted here is intended simply as an interpretation
		of Sen’s approach. It can be argued that the capability
		approach is indeed a useful framework for defining
		disability. Under the capability approach, disability may be analyzed at two separate levels, as a deprivation of capabilities or as a deprivation of functionings. </p>
		<br>
		<p> At the level of personal characteristics, this study uses the
		concept of an impairment rather than a disability, and impairment
		is defined as a physiological, mental, or anatomical loss.
		In terms of capabilities and functionings, deprivation results
		from the interaction among the resources available to the person,
		personal characteristics (e.g., impairment, age, gender),
		and the environment.</p>
